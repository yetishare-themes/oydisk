NEW INSTALLATION:

- Themes can be installed automatically through the admin area of your script installation.
- Login to the admin area
- Select themes, add themes.
- Attach the downloaded zip file and click 'upload theme package'.
- Once uploaded, you can install and configure the theme settings.

- If the above process fails, you can manually upload the theme. Via FTP, go into the themes folder on your install. Create a new folder named the same as the $themeConfig['folder_name'] value in ThemeConfig.class.php. i.e. 'flow' etc. Upload the theme files to this folder. Reload the theme manager via your script admin to see the theme listed.


UPGRADES:

- Backup your existing files and database.
- Re-upload all the theme code to replace your existing code in the themes/[theme_name]/ folder.

Note: Your theme version number can be found in themes/[theme_name]/ThemeConfig.class.php
